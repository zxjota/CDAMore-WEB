    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      Effective date: September 3, 2025<br />
      Application: <strong>CDAMore</strong>
    </div>

    <p>Welcome to CDAMore. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have regarding your information when you use our mobile application, CDAMore (the “App”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in several categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> information you provide directly to us, such as your name, email address, profile information, and any other data you choose to submit.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> information about how you use the App, including features used, pages/screens visited, timestamps, and interaction events.</li>
      <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> device model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, IP address (in masked/anonymized form when possible), carrier, and crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & Cookies:</strong> we use cookies and similar technologies to collect analytics (see “Cookies and Similar Technologies” below).</li>
      <li><strong>Transactional Data:</strong> if the App offers purchases or subscriptions, we collect purchase history and billing details required to complete transactions (payment is processed by third-party payment processors; we do not store full payment card numbers).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, operate, maintain, and improve the App and its features.</li>
      <li>To process transactions and send related information, such as purchase confirmations and invoices.</li>
      <li>To respond to your inquiries and provide customer support.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage patterns and trends to enhance user experience and develop new features.</li>
      <li>To send administrative messages, updates, and promotional communications (you can opt out of marketing messages).</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, security incidents, and abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services for us (payment processors, hosting providers, analytics providers). They are authorized to use your data only as necessary to provide those services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, user data may be transferred to the acquiring entity under terms no less protective than this policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> when required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, or to protect our rights, property, or safety or that of our users.</li>
      <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> we may share personal information with your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>The App may use or link to third-party services (for analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or payments). These third parties have their own privacy practices; we encourage you to review their policies. We are not responsible for their practices or content.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to remember preferences, collect analytics, and support core functionality. You can manage cookie preferences through your device settings; however, disabling some technologies may affect App functionality.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and for legitimate business purposes. When data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards intended to protect personal information. While we strive to protect your data, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have unintentionally collected such information, we will take steps to delete it. If you believe we have collected data from a child under 13, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We operate globally. Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We will protect transferred information in accordance with this policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy with a new effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
